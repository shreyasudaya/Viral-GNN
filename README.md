This code implements a deep learning model for classifying 10 COVID-19 variants using DNA sequences. The model architecture is specified in the Viral-GNN.py file. Training is conducted using the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection module, while the dataset is loaded through the Utils.py file.

## Requirements
Pytorch,
Seaborn,
Torch Geometric,
Matplotlib,
Sklearn,
Torchvision




## Dataset

The Dataset consists of heatmap images split into the image-net format i.e. split into the train and test directories in the ratio of 3:1 for train and test.
The Dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyasudaya/fcgr-covid-variants 

## Evaluation and Train Code

Data preparation follows the algorithm

- Run code:
    1. Take gnn-classifier.ipynb either on colab or kaggle
    2. Run the notebook and convert runtime type to GPU

## Directory Structure

Dataset is also available in directory Dataset, with it consisting of kmers, one-hot and fcgr feature extractions. Alongside this is Feature Ext, which contains the files in order to extract the feature and convert it.
